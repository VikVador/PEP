The interception of rainfall by the forest canopy critically affects the water cycle and, conse- quently, groundwater recharge, climate, and most ecosystems at the Earth surface. Therefore, it is crucial to determine water fluxes induced by canopy interception and to predict how they would evolve with climate change or modifications of land use. Though the canopy intercepts a large proportion of rainwater, only a fraction of it subsequently reaches the ground (as either splashed droplets, drips or stem flow) while the remainder ultimately evaporates. The storage capacity of a leaf, plant or tree is defined as the maximum amount of water that it can store. We may expect that this capacity depends on the compliance of the leafs: a compliant leaf bends in response to the water weight, and then water drains down and drips more easily. However, the exact relationship between storage capacity and leaf compliance is unknown.
